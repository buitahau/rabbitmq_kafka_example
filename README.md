Java Message Service (JMS) is a part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition,
 and is defined by a specification developed under the Java Community Process
 . It is a messaging standard that allows application components based on the
  Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to create, send, receive, and read
  messages. It allows the communication between different components of a
  distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application
layer protocol for message - oriented middleware. The defining features of
AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point - to - point
and publish and subscribe), reliability and security.
